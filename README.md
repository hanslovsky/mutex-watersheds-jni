# Mutex Watersheds JNI interface

**Note**: I created this repository to familiarize myself with Rust. Do not expect maintenance or regular activity or great documentation but feel free to use the library if it fits your needs. Also, as I am a total Rust noob, this library is probably very inefficient and will probably undergo some interface changes in the future.
